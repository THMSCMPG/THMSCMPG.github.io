## Laboratory Reports

### [Determination of the Focal Length of a Thin Lens Using Multiple Experimental Methods]({{ https://THMSCMPG.github.io }}/assets/reports/Determination of the Focal Length Campagna.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* **Course:** Optics
* **Skills:** Error propagation, Gaussian optics analysis, experimental comparative methodology.
* **Summary:** This study experimentally determined the focal length of a converging thin lens using six independent optical methods: object-at-infinity, thin-lens graphical analysis, Lensmaker's Formula, Bessel's Method, Laser Speckle Method, and autocollimation. The results were benchmarked against a vendor-specified 75 mm focal length. Findings demonstrated that collimation-based techniques, specifically the Laser Speckle Method (f=74.0 mm, 1.35% difference), significantly outperformed direct distance measurements by minimizing systematic uncertainties.

### [Precision Laser Beam Profiling: Using Optical Lenses and the Knife-Edge Method]({{ https://THMSCMPG.github.io }}/assets/reports/Precision Laser Beam Profiling Campagna.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* **Course:** Optics
* **Skills:** Error propagation, nonlinear curve fitting, Gaussian beam characterization.
* **Summary:** To characterize spatial light distribution, this project employed the knife-edge scanning method to measure the beam radius (w) of a laser. By fitting the integrated intensity profile (G(x)) to a complementary error function (erfc), the true Gaussian spatial intensity profile (g(x)) was derived. This methodology was used to verify the 5x magnification factor of a Galilean telescope beam expander.

### [Mapping the Magnetic Field of a Short, Thick Solenoid]({{ https://THMSCMPG.github.io }}/assets/reports/Mapping the Magnetic Field Campagna.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* **Course:** University Physics II
* **Skills:** Error propagation, Faraday induction, Biot-Savart Law application.
* **Summary:** This experiment involved building and calibrating a 23-turn coil probe to map the axial magnetic field of a non-ideal, 3,400-turn solenoid. The probe was calibrated using the approximately uniform fields of Helmholtz coils via Faraday induction. Measured data were compared against three theoretical models—infinite solenoid, circular-coil approximation, and thin, finite length solenoid—to analyze the effects of solenoid geometry and field fringing.

### [Painting in Polarization: Optics Final Project]({{ https://THMSCMPG.github.io }}/assets/reports/Final Optics Project.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* **Course:** Optics
* **Skills:** spectral analysis, colorimetry, spectrometer to RGB conversion using Excel.
* **Summary:** This project explored the principles of birefringence and retardance by creating "Polages" (polarization paintings). Using a JAZ Spectrometer and a polarization gate, I verified that phase retardance (δ) is inversely proportional to wavelength (λ). The research confirmed the complementary color relationship between "Open Gate" (parallel) and "Closed Gate" (perpendicular) polarizer configurations, validating the computational process of converting raw spectral data into sRGB colors.
